Project Description

Topic:
The effect of drug decriminilization on overdose deaths and well-being.

Why it matters:
The study of drug decriminalization and overdose rates in Oregon has potential for significant policy and societal relevance. There are many debates on the benefits and drawbacks of drugs use and decriminalization has potential for policy implications involving economics, public health, criminal justice, and community well-being.

Research Question and Motivation:
What is the effect of drug decriminalization on overdose deaths and well-being? A policy change like Oregon's can have significant consequences on populations who are most at risk of overdose deaths and the economic impacts on health care costs and overall well-being. We used the synthetic control method to understand how the policy change impacted Oregon by comparing what would have happened in th absence of the policy being implemented.
